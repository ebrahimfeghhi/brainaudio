I don't think of it as a problem.

What is going on there?
Those are the ones I really enjoy.
I know this one will be really good.
Have you seen this movie?

I am around if you need me.
Place it just a little to the right.
People will come looking for water in this big old house.
I hope I look like I can point them to the right place.

I will take very good care of your house.
The point I am making is that money is not everything.
I see, this is better than before.
I want to talk to you about a couple of things.
I really like her voice.
I hope you think I am doing a good job with this.
After talking to my family I know what is the right thing to do.
My house in the city is old but big.
Both of us will go to the city.
This is another thing to measure.
Everything was going very well.

It is my pleasure to be able to show you my city.

I will go around.
I am talking to my family.
It is looking quite hard.
Why don't you come here.
I usually go home by this time.
Please think this through.
I came here looking for you.
What are you doing right now?
I say we should do this.
We can't see it, can you?
Both of us are going.
This is very good.
I can give you a call next week.
I am trying to say the same thing.
How about we go there together?
Those look very pretty.
Either this week or the next one.
They're doing this on their own.
I hope this is what you need.
She will go around every time.
Saying this does not make it right.
I will have to measure if this is different.
Again, I think this is not the way to go.
Both of us can still make it in time.
You should feel very good about this.
This is far from it.
What makes you stay here?
This is our work.
We live next to the school.
I never guess anything.
Our problems are not very big as their problem.
Our college is quite interesting.
Does it ever go right?
Will you use any of this stuff?
This was a good call.
Going through the city is hard.
Guess who is coming home next week?
I can't hear your voice.
I really like it and yet I am not sure I want it.
How much money do you have?
Hundred things to do now.
Who went with you to the city?
My boy will go with you.
I will feel much better after this.
You have made a great choice.
Someone will give you a call next week.

We have another day to make this right.
I own less stuff than you.
Come to see our new house.
I really like your new car.
How are you even here?
The whole thing went away just like that.
Our needs change over time.
What makes it interesting is that we are all different.
Though I can't let you in, you can stay out here.
Sure, I will give it to her when I see her next.
It's show time.
Come, take a look at this.
My family is going back home next week.
People should remember this.
I will join you after a couple of days.
You should take us with you.
Everything is looking good.
You should see our house.
This is looking bad, but we will make it.
It is made right here.
Let us find out what you need.
This is the most fun part.
I don't like to guess.
This better be good.
I want to eat with my family.
I've seen much more than this.
How old are you?
Water here looks different.
Both of you should make the decision together.
I usually love to eat there.
I will stay with you.
How many days of school are there in a year?
Both of them are still very new here.
Can you get my water?
It has been quite some time.
What do you mean?
Twenty such people came here last week.
I think children will really enjoy this.
This job will end in four years.
Someone is here already.
What are those?
Can you tell me how you exercise?

There will come a day when you will feel better.
What a fun place to be in.
Everything looks better here.

I am not talking to you.
Couple of days to go.
Some people are really good at it.
You should keep it with you for now.
Usually, I like to talk to them first.
How much money is this?
This is a very nice school.
Maybe we should think about it a bit more.
I can't believe how easy this is.
Most of us are going to go away.
My decision is already made.
Don't go back in there.
I didn't mean it like that.
The little one is up already.
Something must go.
What did you do before this?
First one is actually not that bad.
You can pay me two hundred now.
I can't care less about this.
Kids are here to eat.
Who needs a change?
This is even better than what we had before.
You must go through there first.
I believe what you are saying.
How do you have so many new ideas?
It is all coming down now.
We should use every last bit of it.
Kids are not alone in the house.
Show me what you have got there.
My country is very big.
I have a new idea right now.
This is still quite high for me.
I feel great about going to the city.
Do you have a place for my car?
It will probably be very nice.

I think that's the right way.
Please come here now.
I will be here all day.
Did you like our work?
I feel that this is really close.

Did you get the message I left?
And I'm not sure what it is.
I am getting to the point.
Then I won't tell you.

They can do whatever they want.
The only kinds of things that you can use.
That's kind of understandable.

Never gonna give you up.
Never gonna let you down.
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Never gonna make you cry.
Never gonna say goodbye.
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
Well I guess this is it.
It's not that much of a bother really.
We generally don't have to do that.
If I had to do it all again I would.
It's a little different.
At some point it's going to get more expensive.
Very high markups on all items.
We are American restaurants too.
Maybe we'll talk again.
Or maybe for twenty dollars.
