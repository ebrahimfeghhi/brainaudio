It's much more convenient to have one at home.
We were planting flowers this weekend.
That's a bit of a drive for you there.
Those have been real popular with my family.
Forty dollars every two weeks.

We still have a lot of privacy.
We just wipe it right away before it dried.
When you work out.
Change things a little bit.
If it costs them something.

Without charging people.
Four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda.
It's quite a bit different now.
Not as much as I remember growing up.
I couldn't care about any of it.
I just can't do it.
Sitting there wasting away.
Rent a car when you get there and all that.
The further away I get.
We used to do that.
It seems like if you're getting to that level.
The problem is she's a school teacher.
Sewing up the garment itself.
You don't have much spare time either.
I enjoy that too.
As soon as things do get public.
When she came up here.

Out of the state.
I don't know how long you've been here.

To help decide what's the right thing.
Have all this fine Mexican food.
It was good weather.
I'm going to school while I'm working.

When our daughter was looking at colleges.

Kind of a ivory color all over.
Some types of furniture.
Because she makes clothes.
Four hundred hours.
We like the water sports too.
I still go to right back to what I said.

It's American made too which is good.
I just crept over forty years old.
My parents always said if we wanted a car.
If you get pleats.

I grew up in Alabama.
Maybe south.
So I can wander around.
What are you doing with that?
If I had all the money I wanted.
Sleeping bags.
Instead of being completely penned up.
That's not so bad.
In a way it's not.
It shouldn't be that way I don't think.
Voiceover, dialog, spoken text, script, or lyrics.
I have not gone back lately.
What do you think of the spoilers?
They pay so much of it.
Many of the casualties are women and children.
Between the rows and all.
Speaking of noise.
I have no choice but to complete the mission.
What are some of the benefits of visualization?
How do you measure it?
This is the vision that we have.

A lot of restaurants don't take.
Reports on the occasion of the sixth anniversary.
I don't do much with it.

All this kind of stuff.
Now it doesn't bother me at all.
Just like a pig I mean.
Before I retired.

I was at one of the big hospitals in New York.
I have four children.
If that's what you have in mind.
With this problem.
The money that they apparently need.
These behaviors are acceptable and these are not.
Not really rationing water.
Looking at the degree at the end.
To San Francisco for dinner or something.
Because I never realized it.
The boy was conscious and breathing, police said.
That is not terrible.
I work so hard over the weekend.
At this point I had a bit of a meltdown.
The whole premise is that they go out.
I was one of the first to arrive.
You get mixed signals.
My husband says I do it.
Industry type places.
That's that microscopic stuff.
A lot of people I know.
They're just sort of into clothes.
We have day care.
There are no real recycling facilities.
Fifty to a hundred miles every Sunday.
About twenty after four.
Because there are many Italians in Argentina.
What was going on there?
It was my first time in the state of Ohio.
A certain amount of their salary would go to it.
Of course it was with a group.
It's a lot of money.
Some shows are good.
There was that big problem.
From our daily routine.
It was destroyed by the end of the year.
Oh that would be hard.
I think the Catholic religion itself is fine.
Traditional looking.
I mean about fifteen to twenty percent.
The first direction that I can see is up ahead.
Broadcast division of the Associated Press.
Just for that reason.
We're renting a house.
They haven't mass produced enough to do that.
I just think it's such a fun sport.
Oh I think so too.
Whatever manner they want to.
How old are your girls?
I lift weights quite a bit.
We chat at each other.
It's up north.
I don't make any money.
Who could have envisioned that?
All alleged democrats.
The air conditioning problem.
Work in the national parks.
The stable ponies do not let me close to them, usually.
There's a lot of crime.
Wait for anyone to join.
Around this time of the year.
Add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to the water.
I thought that was really funny.
Did that scare you a little bit?
I just feel much better.
When are you joining?
The equation of the party.
It's an odd film and it's really interesting.
What we call a sunroom.
We don't have to worry about that.
That's fantastic exercise.
Data entry stuff.
My teacher looked at it every week.
First thing I did.
That's nice over there.
We just got married.
I changed that.
Any advantage that they can take?
What point were you trying to make in any case?
They're all pretty good.
It's an external modem.
To move forward we have to make both versions visible.
A dish of some kind.
This was when the Peace Corps were first started.
I've also driven one at a track event.
I'm at work today.
The latest cereal.
I'm in the auto parts business myself.
Out of the city by myself.
I'm watching Saturday Night Live here.
Have you ever been?
What the qualifications of the teachers were.
I use a three iron off the tee.
A hundred and two sometimes.
In legislation or in work.
My grandmother's house.
Pleasure to meet both of you.
It was innovative.
A little closer to the edge.
I enjoy gardening.
Didn't he have a woman?
But at my brother's house I tried it.
You could join a walking club.
That's one way to end a conversation.
Have a good life.
As usual, the truth lies somewhere in between.
Either that or Mercedes.
They really are very good.
I watched some football.
It had existed for three years.
The rest of society.
I went skiing.
I guess what I'm trying to get at is.
A woman prosecutor there was murdered.
The nursing home that's just a mile from our house.
I don't very often.
Not one instance.
I grew up in New Jersey.
I don't care for the sound of the high notes.
There was somebody there for them.
So who do you think is going to win the playoffs?
What have your shows been like up to this point?
This was not an unusual request.
It's hard to pinpoint any one thing.
It's something you can all help with.
It's funny because it's not.
He just shot them himself.
Two hundred hours of community service.
All those factors played a part.
You ever seen that movie.
And I was telling him about a couple of weeks ago.
Before they took off this time.
Long story short.
I've always enjoyed doing it by myself.
Gosh, I'm so worried about this alien invasion.
Confusion at home.
The show has changed my life immeasurably.
Because that is a bulb.
He agreed to be in it.
How have we come to this point?
Cooking foods for her.
There is a good chance you're going to get off.
Actually I lived there.
At this point, the answer is irrelevant.
I hear what you're saying.
Is it pretty easy?
I went out to have a good time.
Some of their guidance.
Most of this area was developed.
We have some in laws.
Is that what you're in?
Public execution where it's visible.
Which is a lovely place to grow up.
He only had three employees.
Like a brisket or a roast.
I understand what you're talking about.
I would and I believe in this.
I could do this or that.
It's a little piece of land over there.
I heard it that time.
We have tried to help.
You watch, it'll be exactly the same.
Hotter than usual.
The qualified people.
Aren't you planning to have children?
You shouldn't have a problem with it.
Is that what that was?
I always put cheese on them.
Kind of like my idol when I was growing up.
They have been a couple of times.
There was a regime change.
I've got some exciting news to share about performance measurement.
He was voted the sexiest actor in movies.
It made us be more together.
Go and actually live in that country for a while.
We tried a place called Louisiana Purchase.
The money part of it is not as rewarding.
That's my favorite team.
I have seen that happen lots of times.
Sometimes it is the same people.
Three bread rolls.
They were referred to as savants.
So you have a child?
I'll call and find out.
I like my garden too.
It is difficult to predict at this point of time.
It uses more muscles than any other exercise.
It would still be hard even nowadays.
I do get tired of having to separate paper.
Taking a lot of time.
I'd probably get a third of a pound.
There's this one.
That's basically what we do.
Because I don't know the territory at all.
Ten dollars for the bridges and the roads.
We live in the country.
Please see my full disclosure policy for details.
I am against the taxes for them.
They should keep these people in prison.
I guess she wanted a private life.
They weren't drug fiends.
Put out the trash and stuff.
The original German version is here.
No one knows what that is.
Three hour difference.
That's maybe not so typical.
It's really a release.
It's that grandmother figure.
We have to get rid of them all.
That's the one I watch.
We've got to talk.
She reached up to massage her temples.
Electrical engineering.
I was able to help the coach.
Every other house.
That was Tuesday night.
That would be real good for us.
Know where to draw a line.
What's the word I want?
I thought about that.
Rather odd personality.
I hear mine saying no.
There's no hockey.
Did you start at the edge?
Because they fight the best.
You go ahead first.
Everything around here is set up that way.
I have really ballooned up since then.
Mostly what I wear are skirts and blouses.
I would like to do that as a friend.
It would not get performed by anybody.
Take us down to your new house
It seems that having gone through that is not helpful.
This idea is better than the one children had.
Do you remember making this decision.
Have you ever heard of stuff like this?
Someone will let you in our house in the new city.
I don't think of it as a problem.
She was trying to call you a couple of times.
It does not quite feel right.
I am going from here to there.
That is the one I was thinking about.
She got it just now for you.
They're going to make it even.
School day can be very long.
There are many other things that I know.
What are you doing our here?
Why don't you go up there and have a look?
My real home is right here.
I always go there on my way to school.
What is going on there?
Those are the ones I really enjoy.
I know this one will be really good.
Have you seen this movie?
Either keep your old stuff or buy new things.
We are getting old and work is also getting hard.
Everything I know about this is what I read last week.
Never ever give away your time like that.
Show me what you have.
I am still around if you want to talk.
Looking at the whole thing will make it easy.
Watch the car and the house while we are gone.
I am pretty sure I need less than this.
It is hard to have fun when you have to go to school with this boy.
There is a place to stay close to my house.
Could you take it off now?
What are they doing here?
I said it is nice but I am not into doing easy stuff.
I am around if you need me.
Place it just a little to the right.
People will come looking for water in this big old house.
I hope I look like I can point them to the right place.
They will take down many great movies any day now.
Anything will do at this time I guess.
Have you ever thought about it that way.
I will take very good care of your house.
The point I am making is that money is not everything.
I see, this is better than before.
I want to talk to you about a couple of things.
I really like her voice.
I hope you think I am doing a good job with this.
After talking to my family I know what is the right thing to do.
My house in the city is old but big.
Both of us will go to the city.
This is another thing to measure.
Everything was going very well.
Four hundred doesn't quite feel like a choice.
It is my pleasure to be able to show you my city.
I like to use it every work day.
This makes me less sure about our decision.
I will probably change my full time job at the end.
She was gone by the time I got there.
I need to be there.
The couple is trying to make this last for years to come.
Other little things can always work well here.
Can you think of a good name for our house?
Tell me what to do and I will get it done.
I care about it very much and so should you.
It can take up to two, three, four or even five hundred years.
Do you know some kind of car that is really good.
Doing both together is different and could be more hard work.
Those problems will never go away.
I can go with them and come back.
This is my idea to make it work well.
I will go around.
I am talking to my family.
It is looking quite hard.
Why don't you come here.
I usually go home by this time.
Please think this through.
I came here looking for you.
What are you doing right now?
I say we should do this.
We can't see it, can you?
Both of us are going.
This is very good.
I can give you a call next week.
I am trying to say the same thing.
How about we go there together?
Those look very pretty.
Either this week or the next one.
They're doing this on their own.
I hope this is what you need.
She will go around every time.
Saying this does not make it right.
I will have to measure if this is different.
Again, I think this is not the way to go.
Both of us can still make it in time.
You should feel very good about this.
This is far from it.
What makes you stay here?
This is our work.
We live next to the school.
I never guess anything.
Our problems are not very big as their problem.
Our college is quite interesting.
Does it ever go right?
Will you use any of this stuff?
This was a good call.
Going through the city is hard.
Guess who is coming home next week?
I can't hear your voice.
I really like it and yet I am not sure I want it.
How much money do you have?
Hundred things to do now.
Who went with you to the city?
My boy will go with you.
I will feel much better after this.
You have made a great choice.
Someone will give you a call next week.
Exercise is always good for you.
I believe we have to go to work now.
We have another day to make this right.
I own less stuff than you.
Come to see our new house.
I really like your new car.
How are you even here?
The whole thing went away just like that.
Our needs change over time.
What makes it interesting is that we are all different.
Though I can't let you in, you can stay out here.
Sure, I will give it to her when I see her next.
It's show time.
Come, take a look at this.
My family is going back home next week.
People should remember this.
I will join you after a couple of days.
You should take us with you.
Everything is looking good.
You should see our house.
This is looking bad, but we will make it.
It is made right here.
Let us find out what you need.
This is the most fun part.
I don't like to guess.
This better be good.
I want to eat with my family.
I've seen much more than this.
How old are you?
Water here looks different.
Both of you should make the decision together.
I usually love to eat there.
I will stay with you.
How many days of school are there in a year?
Both of them are still very new here.
Can you get my water?
It has been quite some time.
What do you mean?
Twenty such people came here last week.
I think children will really enjoy this.
This job will end in four years.
Someone is here already.
What are those?
Can you tell me how you exercise?
College can be a great place.
What do you think about it?
This will make it look good.
What is going on here?
Your hard work will pay off.
There will come a day when you will feel better.
What a fun place to be in.
Everything looks better here.
He said she can't come today.
It's a pleasure to work with you.
Why are you after this old car?
Do you remember anything?
All of us need to eat.
Your voice seems better now.
I am not talking to you.
Couple of days to go.
Some people are really good at it.
You should keep it with you for now.
Usually, I like to talk to them first.
How much money is this?
This is a very nice school.
Maybe we should think about it a bit more.
I can't believe how easy this is.
Most of us are going to go away.
My decision is already made.
Don't go back in there.
I didn't mean it like that.
The little one is up already.
Something must go.
What did you do before this?
First one is actually not that bad.
You can pay me two hundred now.
I can't care less about this.
Kids are here to eat.
Who needs a change?
This is even better than what we had before.
You must go through there first.
I believe what you are saying.
How do you have so many new ideas?
It is all coming down now.
We should use every last bit of it.
Kids are not alone in the house.
Show me what you have got there.
My country is very big.
I have a new idea right now.
This is still quite high for me.
I feel great about going to the city.
Do you have a place for my car?
It will probably be very nice.
My part in this is not very big.
Let me tell you my real name.
I hope you stay to eat with us.
I am just another person.
My high school was really my first choice.
I have everything I need right here.
Could you put that in the car?
He made our house look very pretty.
They are over there, I can see them.
I hope you heard what they said.
Your voice is very nice.
I enjoy my job.
This is my house.
Let me tell you about our work.
I am talking to you.
Come to see our work.
I have been there.
Are you going this week?
I have a lot to do.
I will get all of this done.
People will come now.
This is really very good.
I am good, how are you?
Will you come with me?
I can see her over there.
I can see you from here.
What did you say just now?
I know you like it.
Isn't this very good?
I like to go to the city.
I love my house.
I think that's the right way.
Please come here now.
I will be here all day.
Did you like our work?
I feel that this is really close.
When can we go to the city?
This is far away from my home.
I am not quite sure about it.
I work very hard.
I want to go there with my family.
You should see our work.
Your new house is very nice.
I don't have a choice.
I don't care about this.
We are very close to the college.
I want to go home now.
I will see you in two days.
It's good to know this.
I want to show you this.
Let us start going from here.
I really enjoy my time in the city.
I am doing quite well.
We made this decision at work.
When will you come here?
My other house is close by.
Many people will come for this.
They say it is quite easy.
What are you doing next week?
What is your name?
I can't believe this is real.
How is your life in the new city?
What choice do we have?
Did you like this?
We work very hard on this.
Yes, I would like that very much.
What time do you get off from work?
I can see you next week.
Can you hear me say this?
I don't get what you are saying.
I was not looking at it at that time.
Did you enjoy this movie?
Please come to see our work.
You know more about this than me.
He is twenty years old this year.
How much do you know about this?
This is looking very good.
Can you get me water?
Don't you think this is very good?
My family will come home now.
What do you think about this?
We should go there next week.
Anything will do for now.
These people are very kind.
What do you want to do now?
Some of us will go there first.
I like to watch that show.
I had fun last week.
You just have to try it out.
It has been a long time.
We should go there first.
Maybe he won't remember this.
I think I have seen this before.
My family is talking to me now.
Let's do this another day.
We have to go through the city first.
I have read this book hundred times.
My house is really not that far.
I will go there now.
She is away for a week.
She can do pretty much anything.
We can go around the school.
Only few people have seen this show.
I was trying to have some fun.
I need some more time for my work.
This place needs a change.
I am making this to eat next week.
Our problems will go away.
I do not own a car.
It is a pleasure to be with kids.
Our children are away at this time.
We were doing everything right.
Can you tell me my part?
I know this is a lot for now.
Most of these are quite old.
I would like to go to watch that new movie.
He is still here.
I used to like this show last year.
I'll be right back.
I will also come with you to eat.
We have made a right choice.
This work will take a couple of days.
We've seen better jobs.
Either this or that.
I left all my stuff at the college.
This is an interesting point.
I mean my home has everything.
He really said that to me.
I like my college more now.
We all need a change for a few days.
You should enjoy your time there.
Please take this back with you.
She went home last week.
How could you say this to me.
One more year has gone.
This is such a great place.
I think this is not very hard.
I will put my money here.
This was three years ago.
What was that other place?
Give this to me right now.
Yes, this is true.
I will not buy more of these.
We should go together to find him.
I love to talk with children.
Do you know what was here before?
Can you guess this movie?
People are just like that.
I used to do this in my college life.
Actually, we both work there.
I care about my school very much.
Old people will need help with this.
That boy was going over there.
Usually, this takes five days.
People have seen better times.
I don't like this sort of work.
I want to buy a house in the city.
I have not seen this yet.
Do you believe in me?
My idea points to the same thing.
Make sure you read it again.
I can stay here for few more days.
What does he do for work?
I must change my job soon.
I like to own less stuff.
Your place is looking great.
We are almost through.
I can talk to you while I work.
Someone left this here for you.
It's quite easy for you.
How can we measure this?
I'd love to join you to eat.
We will come after some time.
I always call her when I am there.
Do you even know what this is?
She went to find him just a while ago.
I don't remember this from last year.
We've seen this many times before.
This is my first day of college.
You have to live with the choice you made.
Your voice is getting better.
This couple is going home now.
This is big even for me.
I will say this only once.
Don't make me go there again.
How long have you been here?
What time is it?
Will you go back home right away?
I guess this is real.
I really want to go there.
What does this mean?
We all have a choice.
Is this your day off?
I was not in on this.
As you know, we will go there next week.
I want to make this very easy.
What are you doing?
We are all fine here.
This is looking great.
Who lives in this house?
We love to stay in the country.
All the work we can get done.
Are you up to it?
When I came you were gone.
So much to do and so little time.
What are you thinking right now?
Now I really want to know more about this.
What a pleasure to work with you.
My children live in the city.
We don't have much time.
I want to make this right.
He will pay for this.
My family will join us in a while.
What time will they come here?
I hope this will work out.
Some of us will stay at home.
You should make a different choice.
We must go there now.
All of us like this a lot.
Only five days to go.
Her house is so far away.
Which movie did you watch?
What do people think of me?
Where are you going next?
I was not sure this was the right thing to do.
So many things to do before next week.
You are very kind.
I love this movie too.
Please enjoy your stay here.
Only few more days to go.
I can't wait to see you.
I feel very good about this.
She did not say much.
Who needs so much stuff to live?
Maybe we do have a choice.
How much do I have to pay you?
Other people don't think this will do.
I'll have the same.
I have done this only once before.
This is a great place to live.
Who told you that?
That's not true at all.
How do you feel about going there?
I got some good exercise.
My city is full of interesting people.
Stay away from this house.
What's that you are looking at?
Five different ways.
This job is better than most.
Give me some time to think about it.
How are things at home?
Are you both doing the same job?
What did you find in the country?
That's not my problem.
Tell me what you think about this.
I guess this is quite real.
You made it look very nice.
What a pretty little place.
Where are you off to?
I still haven't made a decision.
I can't be away from work.
Maybe I will use it next week.
I have seen that boy before.
Where did they go?
Call me after a couple of days.
This is just another thing to remember.
Tell her that you will join the college.
I believe I get twenty points for this.
Having this idea seems very easy.
Stay close to the house when you go out.
I have seen that he goes there every day.
Could you measure this for me please?
How far are we from the city?
It will be easy if we do it together.
I can't come because my family is here.
Do you know what is at the end of this?
She was trying to live far from the city.
I need to look into this.
Your work is getting better.
We should probably see this at the end.
I wasn't looking for a new job yet.
Can someone go there in a couple of days?
I still care about my old stuff.
I can hear your voice from here.
What did you say your name was?
He called four times already.
Let us go around the house and take a look.
