3542,when i think of drug testing.
3543,oh if you have your health.
3544,the minute i said the word.
3545,and pretend like he's playing games you know.
3546,the system right now.
3547,because it's her business and everything.
3548,if i've got time.
3549,you don't blame that.
3550,i've got one that's seven and one that's three.
3551,she works with him.
3552,salad with cupboards.
3553,and they don't learn the communications.
3554,and believe me you'll know the difference.
3555,you know what i would love.
3556,so that was upsetting.
3557,that they can't do as good a job.
3558,more of them doing men's fields.
3559,i should be able to do things like this.
3560,i have preferences.
3561,it's not really like this.
3562,when they have teachers' holidays.
3563,i don't think i've heard anything on the rangers.
3564,about how many calls have you made on this system?
3565,three strikes against them when they're out there.
3566,and we went out to dinner with some friends.
3567,they live in alabama.
3568,and they were not really fighting.
3569,a really important thing to me is when they would come.
3570,had a living room.
3571,and so they just fit in there.
3572,last christmastime.
3573,that's a nightmare.
3574,we had such an economic slowdown.
3575,this one that you raised.
3576,i guess that i really don't know that much.
3577,he's not that old.
3578,i'm hoping that we can work something out here.
3579,it's just hysterical.
3580,i see at least two a week.
3581,and it also helps when they were winning.
3582,there are plenty of good people.
3583,the internal problems.
3584,the whole electronic classroom idea.
3585,then maybe there is no hope.
3586,they get taken up at the store.
3587,you utilize all of it.
3588,i do play the piano.
3589,and live happy lives.
3590,a little trinket for each day.
3591,i've done that for college football.
3592,we do some projects every now and then.
3593,i've heard that she's done real cool things.
3594,about twenty years ago.
3595,that's a whole new field in itself.
3596,he's been a legend for so many years.
3597,is there a basis for it?
3598,provide medicine to their family mens.
3599,or if you haven't sold property.
3600,i had my school do it.
3601,just something fun to do.
3602,they're in there.
3603,a circuit court judge.
3604,if william kennedy smith had been found guilty.
3605,would you consider.
3606,but that's not really exactly immigration.
3607,forms for things.
3608,and so i've seen a variety of types of benefits.
3609,it's real little.
3610,very scary to see what they found out.
3611,and no matter where you build it.
3612,i decided it is not worth it.
3613,i mean the kids can be a real pest.
3614,violence oriented.
3615,be settled anywhere.
3616,i sit and design cards.
3617,we hadn't did it ourselves.
3618,is it worse than smoking?
3619,the more people offer them to you.
3620,so i tend to read a lot of the baseball books.
3621,and that kind of thing.
3622,doesn't seem so far.
3623,with the smoking premise.
3624,well that's kind of good to know.
3625,a lot of different comedies.
3626,you just think to yourself.
3627,any experience you've had at work.
3628,it was just terrible.
3629,i don't have to worry a whole lot about that.
3630,oh that's a big thrill for them.
3631,then i finally made it to england.
3632,those are all great.
3633,but i was thinking.
3634,since that's all they do is news to dig deeper.
3635,maybe we'll talk again.
3636,had an impact on the society around here.
3637,i mean it's not going to be overnight.
3638,i really have not seen them.
3639,they could sell five.
3640,you can always heat it up again.
3641,it's kind of a concern for me.
3642,that is pretty good.
3643,i knit sometimes.
3644,they don't get to see their grandkids.
3645,i listen to like ninety seven point one.

3652,they refused to give him more salary.
3653,there's both sides to it too.
3654,there's minimum wage jobs.
3655,they're just so suspenseful.
3656,maybe it was november i'm thinking about.
3657,they're not going to voluntarily say.
3658,i don't read a lot of nonfiction.
3659,the one they have taken.
3660,it was basically.
3661,or does it have to?
3662,you don't have to be an expert to play.
3663,you couldn't really talk.
3664,it sounds like it's good.
3665,i was really surprised.
3666,foundation planning.
3667,or evaluate a person by that.
3668,i still live in san jose.
3669,twelve hours away.
3670,nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once.
3671,maybe eighteen inches.
3672,i hope you can find it.
3673,nothing comparable.
3674,they're all former lawyers.
3675,one of the reasons.
3676,i'd respond probably by biting or something.
3677,and then i worked for dragon systems for a while.
3678,i guess my concern is what we are reading.
3679,it's hard to follow.
3680,it went the other way.
3681,and she won't even think about it.
3682,and put it in front of the walmart store in town.
3683,it's a eighty eight.

3732,they just drop it in.
3733,if you do have to go sometime.

5098,pull out couches and all that.
5099,it was a difference.
5100,with the classical tastes i had mentioned.
5101,i can not remember his name now.
5102,her daughter actually was.
5103,except when we need them.
5104,you know that children can't.
5105,that was a lifesaver.
5106,we're going to have to do something.
5107,that's something.
5108,you know i don't know.
5109,we had a case like that here.
5110,they would let you use it maybe once a year.
5111,that's not their problem.
5112,everybody is really interesting.
5113,my two little ones.
5114,you've already been preapproved.
5115,which is unfortunate for them.
5116,hopefully the new ones will be a lot better.
5117,when you think about it.
5118,potatoes and onions and bell peppers.
5119,i'm being very good.
5120,we have a seven year old.
5121,when i don't have money.
5122,you can't find them.
5123,the time frame which they get paid.
5124,because of the institutional food.
5125,do you watch the network?
5126,i guess i can relate to that.
5127,you're thirty days late.
5128,run a business out of my home.
5129,in my little world.
5130,i knew it was easier back here.
5131,that's a big part of my decision.
5132,my parents would have a fit probably.
5133,it's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers.
5134,quite a way away.
5135,you've read that one before.
5136,i've seen all of this.
5137,that happens on occasion.
5138,i think that's the way this is done.
5139,i get them rarely and i'm still astounded.
5140,the jury system itself.
5141,people are just too different.
5142,it's just a lot of fun.
5143,what group you happen to be in.
5144,you all are waiting for that.
5145,if something caught my eye.
5146,didn't he though.
5147,there's some trees like the oaks.
5148,we didn't have that.
5149,when i was in dallas i was supervisor.
5150,even when someone has been convicted.
5151,if you can pull it off.
5152,we bought a van last year.
5153,then i could take the van.
5154,i'm in favor of very little clean up.
5155,that helps us sort of feel good.
5156,you own the company.
5157,we're going to romania in a few weeks.
5158,i'm dying to see that.
5159,you talked about something.
5160,they should have one year and one appeal.
5161,i just want to get down and kiss the ground.
5162,it could be used to hassle somebody.
5163,we're just stealing it.
5164,recently moved here from north carolina.
5165,a good southern solution.
5166,they all play different songs.
5167,if i could remember the name.
5168,i find it very silly.
5169,that should be governed by by the government.
5170,i haven't really gotten back into exercising.
5171,i went back tonight also.
5172,there's no deductions.
5173,you know i don't change my own oil.
5174,i saw that movie too.
5175,the entire bank is not like that.
5176,trying to control whatever.
5177,the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family.
5178,that's what i wondered.
5179,they don't know that i don't use drugs.
5180,then you are busy.
5181,i don't think they're out of line.
5182,that's a serious truck.
5183,at the time that's what i taught.
5184,my shell credit card.
5185,there was some girl there.
5186,we were doing it.
5187,we've got a one story house now.
5188,it was always my mother's fault.
5189,there's a couple teachers up there.
5190,with the topic i think i agree with you.
5191,they're going to change that.
5192,you think about it now.
5193,you're not going to.
5194,everybody has a different thing.
5195,they just have hopeless lives.
5196,my daughter is twenty one now.
5197,he just brings stuff alive.
5198,they like just the traditional.
5199,my major criteria.
5200,i just don't feel right.
5201,you get the bill and send it to him.
5202,he won't do that yet.
5203,the infant is going to lay in the crib all day.
5204,i don't have to live through many.
5205,it's very safe in the daytime.
5206,i worked my way into having the same engine.
5207,a towel down or something.
5208,here's what you have got.
5209,same with my husband.
5210,few places now seem to do it by the slice.
5211,in the middle of our okra.
5212,on the night before his sixteenth birthday.
5213,weekly magazines.
5214,we've had her now for about three years.
5215,that person rushes you.
5216,i do study what's going on in the economy.
5217,we try to do one thing once a year.
5218,the two seats up front.
5219,there's just something about that cadillac.
5220,they're recycling cans and paper.
5221,a lot of people don't even like to carpool.
5222,if you don't refuse it.
5223,knocked the socks off of them.
5224,if i was setting up a daycare.
5225,a lot of times i'd help her with that.
5226,they fought individually.
5227,but i got talked into the bike instead.
5228,a lot of us have parents.
5229,as a social to meet people.
5230,i don't know if you like the mayor.
5231,in the ground floor.
5232,let's make them have a degree in economy.
5233,i haven't followed it real closely at all.
5234,you're right.
5235,out of an office every day.
5236,we still don't know what he does.
5237,at a million dollars.
5238,i've never quite understood that.
5239,we're over as far as our rainfall goes.
5240,we're very family oriented.
5241,it's thirty degrees this morning.
5242,a new york style.
5243,i prefer a swimming pool.
5244,they're all gone at this point.
5245,do you remember that?
5246,the basic idea.
5247,i have more energy when i exercise.
5248,that is something i really enjoy doing.
5249,what was the name of that?
5250,i bet that would be more fun.
5251,he is a former president of guatemala.
5252,i was much younger.
5253,in other countries.
5254,i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on.
5255,you take away a person's freedom.
5256,it's on from seven to nine.
5257,i don't think it's the teachers.
5258,i've been involved in electronics a long time.
5259,i don't know what advice i'd give them.
5260,they seemed so proud of everything they did.
5261,i've been playing.
5262,she and her husband both do.
5263,i'll forget to pay the bill by the due date.
5264,they're teaching terrorism.
5265,the taxes are there to support.
5266,a place called quality auto parts.
5267,they've enjoyed the school.
5268,there would be no way to do it.
5269,we love fresh vegetables in the summer.
5270,i vote religiously.
5271,that one that you had.
5272,it just became such a pain.
5273,i've seen his other movies.
5274,you got to pay to park at the student center.
5275,what did you normally do?
5276,have a handle on it.
5277,why don't you like the mustang?
5278,we just now found her.
5279,you get back into a political thing.
5280,they do that here.
5281,she's not feeling too great today.
5282,much more crime than ever before.
5283,how does this grab you?
5284,with jim's schedule.
5285,what do you want to do?
5286,we didn't even call them.
5287,venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves.
5288,when we decided to move.
5289,what's it like from an artist's point of view?
5290,i don't think they're in a conspiracy.
5291,we get upgraded.
5292,these are the voyages of the starship enterprise.
5293,sort of the ground level.
5294,are you a boy or a girl?
5295,i would say about ten or fifteen years ago.
5296,this is the first time.
5297,i do pull for chicago.
5298,if you have a drug testing program.
5299,a lot of people get convicted.
5300,they're always laying people off.
5301,may of last year.
5302,we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life.
5303,our financial budget.
5304,sort of seems to be taking.
5305,is that putting too fine a point on it?
5306,make or break you.
5307,that sort of stuff.
5308,but this is usually not the case.
5309,we are not real consistent with this.
5310,he probably knows.
5311,especially if you write like papers.
5312,you have to cut each thing.
5313,desperate times call for desperate measures.
5314,in our particular situation.
5315,when she realizes he's in the house.
5316,i want him back but it's not my decision.
5317,in this stage of my life.
5318,it's carbon so that makes sense.
5319,do you all get together often?
5320,for the first time in years i began to feel joy.
5321,cats are pretty independent.
5322,it just tells a story about life.
5323,opinion is going to be heard.
5324,i guess about a week ago.
5325,my mother worked.
5326,yes you can get an idea of what's going on.
5327,heat oil in a medium pan over medium high heat.
5328,find someone and pay them to do it.
5329,it was a decision he would come to regret.
5330,so we put hers in.
5331,i wanted to get out and see some things.
5332,which is a good idea.
5333,paid attention to them.
5334,what is the vision for the future of this city?
5335,however that decision was overturned on appeal.
5336,she's gone three mornings.
5337,a medical problem.
5338,take those subjects.
5339,this is one of those things.
5340,the freeze just got them.
5341,when i go into the hot tub before i go swimming.
5342,it was about five hundred pages.
5343,that kind of calms him down for the most part.
5344,what is the most enjoyable part of your job?
5345,feel free to use the color scheme of your choice.
5346,it's not an easy decision to make.
5347,so it should be an easy decision right?
5348,that was kind of fun.
5349,you wouldn't know that.
5350,you don't have an annual fee there.
5351,when they recognize that it's their tax money.
5352,they thought it was too much of a bother.
5353,the southwest medical center.
5354,i think sooner or later.
5355,got to see pikes peak.
5356,that was the one from california.
5357,at this point it's up in the air he said.
5358,how did the situation get to this point?
5359,when you find the right cookbook.
5360,my taxes have gone up.
5361,there were no other injuries in the collision.
5362,so far no casualties have been reported.
5363,i like doing that part.
5364,it just flew all over the place.
5365,it's very hard to say.
5366,it's a pleasure to meet you.
5367,it wasn't like pre kindergarten.
5368,so they'll stop me.
5369,that takes a lot of time.
5370,it takes forever to get a call through.
5371,it weighs less than the line.
5372,i wouldn't want to spend more than two nights.
5373,translated and edited by voices of ukraine.
5374,one day would be sufficient.
5375,i've had that happen.
5376,there are some smart ones out there.
5377,the phase of the moon.
5378,a six hundred dollar three piece suit.
5379,a lot of companies are.
5380,you realize why we were in the middle east.
5381,you don't use any credit cards.
5382,you're more fun though.
5383,she thought long and hard about this decision.
5384,i bought it for cheaper.
5385,anyway i hope you enjoy it as much as i do.
5386,but i think i'd like it.
5387,a nursing home or anything.
5388,worked in fast food restaurants.
5389,when i think of crime.
5390,but it's well worth it and everything.
5391,i'm going to.
5392,somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer.
5393,he is also a member of the royal irish academy.
5394,it's because you've been there.
5395,it's a lot like camping.
5396,it's just me in the house.
5397,senior citizens home.
5398,how did we get to this point?
5399,i see it go anywhere.
5400,it was unusual to say the least.
5401,if i had a third one.
5402,to what do i owe the pleasure of your company?
5403,i guess i did not.
5404,we will miss every once in a while.
5405,what had gone on?
5406,better running automobiles.
5407,that sounds real good.
5408,i believe i would probably tend towards that.
5409,my husband and all the men.
5410,i think she loved that dog more than i did.
5411,people do it for their children.
5412,everyone grow up and mature.
5413,anybody tries to hurt them i won't even blink.
5414,on the radiator behind the dresser.
5415,we ended up watching it for a couple of hours.
5416,i have an hour here.
5417,bunch of books that i read.
5418,it was a pleasure talking to you.
5419,like any lottery.
5420,i decided to do it i haven't talked before.
5421,he's almost a teenager.
5422,i think it's a little bit inefficient.
5423,there was some really nasty patronizing.
5424,the kitchen table.
5425,we will worry about who he is later.
5426,i was in education and in administration.
5427,he's gotten good service.
5428,which leads me to my next point.
5429,especially with teenagers.
5430,a lot of things we don't like.
5431,we change our rights with our social status.
5432,that really adds up too.
5433,we're close enough so they can do that.
5434,people seem to enjoy it so it's a good thing.
5435,she'd much rather be here with me.
5436,i could do it now.
5437,a decision is expected in august at the earliest.
5438,they're just too weird to work on now.
5439,and what was the point of it all?
5440,i just don't understand that.
5441,gouging your eyes out.
5442,he said what did you get a deal for?
5443,that was all we ever saw.
5444,we don't ever catch enough to eat.
5445,you have children i take it.
5446,they won't take those.
5447,i like soundtracks a lot.
5448,i'm calling you from work.
5449,they had chosen santa barbara.
5450,he wouldn't really talk about it.
5451,who was that with?
5452,i'm also in dallas.
5453,we're probably reaching a successful stage.
5454,what do you think about places?
5455,it is just wonderful to talk to you.
5456,then other groups come in and do the services.
5457,they had permanent tickets.
5458,harm or injury.
5459,that concerned me.
5460,you have to have a roof over your head.
5461,houston and san antonio.
5462,it was overnight.
5463,what have you seen?
5464,moving around.
5465,came out around the first of the year.
5466,they're not going to change that to meters.
5467,they're going to go on a cruise.
5468,i had to work in an elderly home.
5469,if there's a game on.
5470,which makes a difference.
5471,there's no other way.
5472,well that sounds wonderful.
5473,couldn't catch one to save your life.
5474,it's a real good concept.
5475,do you have pets?
5476,it's a miniature.
5477,i'm an engineer.
5478,it was very modern.
5479,my mom's like i am.
5480,whatever pop we drink.
5481,it was an interesting theory.
5482,is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns?
5483,i feel the same way.
5484,i don't think we gained any weight from it.
5485,i always wanted to go to school for nursing.
5486,it seems like you get hit the worst.
5487,on the south side is all glass.
5488,you go outside and play.
5489,i'm not sure about the name.
5490,why don't you tell me about yours?
5491,it's situational.
5492,in the common areas and in the island.
5493,if they're above the knee they turn into shorts.
5494,in a new house everything is white.
5495,we have an eleven year old.
5496,they were pretty much in good taste.
5497,i wasn't really keeping count.
5498,winning a sweepstakes.
5499,i don't really know how to resolve this.
5500,something back in the sixties.
5501,i had a call the other day from birmingham.
5502,running their country for them.
5503,no income taxes in texas.
5504,i have many a time called him to come get me.
5505,where are they going to get the money?
5506,at least in this country.
5507,it means that i don't have to cook.
5508,frequently purchase and read.
5509,it was just so realistic.
5510,god will take care of us when it's our time.
5511,i wish i could.
5512,don't overcook it though.
5513,everybody is there to have a good time.
5514,neither kid likes to practice.
5515,you know we have to think about that.
5516,you had pretty good luck with one coat type paint.
5517,i hope i never have to use them.
5518,wouldn't have the language barrier certainly.
5519,i agree with you.
5520,monday night is real good with me.
5521,i just finally ended up going to see it.
5522,a pretty significantly small number.
5523,i would like my next car to have good gas mileage.
5524,actually i even understood it better.
5525,they don't want it to change their lifestyle.
5526,some of them were even better behaved.
5527,are you going to trade it in on this new one?
5528,it's not industrial engineering.
5529,they're saying other people were.
5530,driving for thanksgiving.
5531,he had a hot pad.
5532,it would make me sick.
5533,i was thrilled to death.
5534,i just came in from outside.
5535,then we get out of that phase.
5536,i know which one it is.
5537,which ones are you watching?
5538,i don't think i would have.
5539,he suddenly got sick.
5540,i think that i don't.
5541,i do agree with you.
5542,i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in.
5543,cultural change within the management first.
5544,exercise is not supposed to do that to you.
5545,the house is forty years old.
5546,i am nervous in dallas.
5547,it's not that much of a bother really.
5548,they waited a couple years.
5549,it's the other way around.
5550,three hours difference.
5551,actually the lions are pretty good.
5552,in hospitals.
5553,survey system.
5554,they consider it violent.
5555,i've been there.
5556,at the higher echelons.
5557,your favorite inexpensive places.
5558,i think they need that.
5559,i have discovered that.
5560,that's a great salad in summertime.
5561,my kids were quite small.
5562,i haven't seen too many lately.
5563,i have fun doing it.
5564,they cross pollinate just by bees.
5565,he's written a lot of books.
5566,i'm just a regular looking guy.
5567,i think that's a possibility.
5568,we jumped in on the western trip.
5569,we have a hot tub in the back.
5570,maybe we'll get your guy.
5571,as near as i could tell.
5572,she didn't have to do anything anymore.
5573,i heard it on the radio.
5574,beyond a reasonable doubt.
5575,especially in the presidential elections.
5576,she had to go back to work.
5577,i got it right after high school.
5578,i was going to say i always enjoyed that.
5579,it's hard not to like it.
5580,who did work back in nineteen eighty six?
5581,at first that always kind of bothered me.
5582,there's an employment problem.
5583,i think she has problems with that.
5584,in rebellion against the united states.
5585,that's kind of funny.
5586,you have to do something.
5587,at night you can go walking in the shallows.
5588,tour sort of thing.
5589,i think that's real dangerous.
5590,you have to really just get an accurate amount.
5591,i remember when i was that age.
5592,that gives us special time together too.
5593,except you get to taste the product instead.
5594,i think you'll get a real kick out of it.
5595,under the stands.
5596,they're actually going to extend it.
5597,that's kind of a basic thing of economics.
5598,they need to make a living.
5599,see that's the thing.
5600,no thinking involved.
5601,sometimes it doesn't work.
5602,they had people who did.
5603,i want to take a few of these.
5604,i certainly can't argue with that.
5605,look at the statistics.
5606,they just couldn't.
5607,his side of the family.
5608,that's probably the worst.
5609,neither one of us knew much about cars.
5610,our son's not as interested in it as our daughter.
5611,i have to say that i'm honestly for it.
5612,i have not been out of school that long.
5613,it's really cute.
5614,the test is a booger.
5615,i just didn't know.
5616,an undergraduate degree.
5617,i was careful to keep her away.
5618,it's been really good.
5619,you are the one who signed up.
5620,overcast and threatening rain all day.
5621,what do you do?
5622,something besides license plates and lyrics.
5623,we don't listen to any elevator music at my house.
5624,we don't want them back this year.
5625,that sounds really nice.
5626,we're heavy into that too.
5627,that is just personal feeling.
5628,children of my own.
5629,i can't even remember.
5630,the little boy dies.
5631,i've seen pretty woman and dances with wolves.
5632,it destroys their libido.
5633,i've seen them on tv.
5634,i think that is an excellent program.
5635,i'll stick with it while it's good.
5636,to make a little extra money.
5637,i would much rather own my own home.
5638,it loses it somewhere.
5639,who did you vote for?
5640,it's hard for me to imagine that.
5641,when you stop to think of it.
5642,how much coverage?
5643,i used to watch sixty minutes as a matter of fact.
5644,what good is that?
5645,i remember one time up in nashville.
5646,it is very comfortable to drive.
5647,after five years.
5648,down here i haven't fished much in texas.
5649,i'd love to get used to that shotgun.
5650,how long have you been in this house?
5651,even at home here now.
5652,i'd probably buy another.
5653,i just got a little booklet.
5654,that's what i hear.
5655,he was friends with my children.
5656,the stepping back.
5657,i have such a big army outside of my place.
5658,you can't do that.
5659,we are really saving a lot of money.
5660,how long are we supposed to talk for?
5661,what kind of shoes do they wear down there?
5662,i guess there are a few things around still.
5663,it had to be done.
5664,once the children were grown.
5665,you sort of play every now and then.
5666,from what i can tell.
5667,not just some doctor's office somewhere.
5668,he's out of there.
5669,i was born in sixty seven.
5670,check our teeth once a year at least.
5671,is everything still pretty square?
5672,wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower.
5673,the organization can use the help too.
5674,he couldn't even check the oil.
5675,for a hundred dollars.
5676,that's always fun.
5677,he's been put away.
5678,i haven't really heard much about that recently.
5679,when the kids get older.
5680,free major medical for all.
5681,treasury did not immediately provide a comment.
5682,that sounds so easy.
5683,i'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out.
5684,there are several reasons for the confusion.
5685,their statistics aren't very accurate.
5686,it is a conversion thing.
5687,i ended up at the theater.
5688,no reasons were provided for the decision.
5689,it keeps you in the company.
5690,arts and sciences college.
5691,be able to play a little more.
5692,out into the world.
5693,they're wonderful.
5694,he was a movie director.
5695,it's not your decision to make.
5696,give a voice to the voiceless.
5697,we've sort of had an ideal spring.
5698,a junior league achievement.
5699,maybe they're counting on that.
5700,are you happy with this decision?
5701,i've just been doing it.
5702,it's a lot easier then.
5703,we're not feeling too well over here.
5704,what led to the decision to start a record label?
5705,i picked it for a couple of reasons.
5706,you have the chance to really create.
5707,my husband just died.
5708,good housekeeping.
5709,that's what i call home.
5710,are you familiar with that?
5711,some of that is really bad.
5712,i can cut that much off the end.
5713,at this point it is what it is.
5714,you really have to watch those interest rates.
5715,you have to look around at the school.
5716,in the back of our minds.
5717,i've caught a few worthwhile snappers.
5718,however there is no actual way to measure this.
5719,after we got married we moved.
5720,that kind you've read recently.
5721,stay in one single family home.
5722,he got off right away.
5723,i find that really helps.
5724,it's not quite that hot.
5725,get them out there.
5726,make life and death decisions for other people.
5727,a built in window box.
5728,away from his wife.
5729,been on a cruise.
5730,i wasn't really.
5731,did you have to draw a line?
5732,that would be tough.
5733,the sooner we make that decision the better.
5734,he was talking about the three things you could do.
5735,they don't go and see them.
5736,they are out in six or seven.
5737,she was delivered the next day.
5738,i think it's interesting to look at.
5739,mostly just the lakes around here.
5740,again our choices are not made in a vacuum.
5741,my husband's retired.
5742,why they're kind of behind.
5743,that worked out very well for you.
5744,trump's budget is just a proposal at this point.
5745,this brings me to the next point.
5746,clearly this guy is trying to make a point.
5747,why was this decision made and why now?
5748,you don't have time.
5749,every little bit helps.
5750,i'm not sure i'd do that.
5751,i can't think of the name.
5752,trying to stick in with that.
5753,we saw a policeman.
5754,there was no immediate word on any casualties.
5755,i've been making a hot sandwich.
5756,we chose to have our official feelings hurt.
5757,i think nursing homes can be good.
5758,and on that point i have to agree with them.
5759,it's just a couple hours.
5760,i watched the news.
5761,those jurors don't know.
5762,meditation or whatever.
5763,a garbage bag in the garage.
5764,maybe more qualified.
5765,i was having to walk along the highway.
5766,we send some of it out.
5767,i don't much care about things like that.
5768,keeping things concise is usually the way to go.
5769,we hope you enjoy and share us with your friends.
5770,they both cooperate together.
5771,she has two little boys.
5772,we can help you make the right choice.
5773,we like our area.
5774,many of our local power plants.
5775,i feel better.
5776,do you enjoy working on this kind of stuff?
5777,how did you feel it went?
5778,you are trying to avoid paying taxes.
5779,it's nice for them.
5780,there's quite a few.
5781,don't eat the yolk at all.
5782,he said he's been saying one more.
5783,aid to other countries.
5784,this was in a bathroom too.
5785,i like good family shows.
5786,just so you'll know.
5787,after an entire semester.
5788,i haven't been back in five years.
5789,we do everything we possibly can as a family.
5790,i may or may not even look at the tv guide.
5791,crimes and atrocities before.
5792,i'm a single mom.
5793,our church each year.
5794,it's right there at the very foot of the rockies.
5795,i've found some doctors.
5796,draw your own conclusions.
5797,they have exercise.
5798,very much compared to my mother in law.
5799,i don't care anything about that.
5800,that's because he's probably doing what i do.
5801,about the fourth day.
5802,you'll have one or two that are good.
5803,i think that's what it is.
5804,if you really computed it.
5805,i think they were very happy.
5806,we are grateful for the pleasure of serving you.
5807,one evening or something.
5808,twenty something.
5809,some really significant things coming out of it.
5810,but the treasury insisted that was not the case.
5811,my husband didn't like that.
5812,i saw that the other day.
5813,because their dad was at work.
5814,if young people had to do it.
5815,you say it is all voluntary.
5816,even though they didn't bring it in.
5817,i can hear it in your voice.
5818,i think our next car.
5819,which is most unfortunate because we all lose out.
5820,anyhow i guess we both agree.
5821,what i saw on the news today.
5822,i highly recommend it.
5823,that will get them out.
5824,was it the right decision?
5825,you really think so?
5826,what did you think of the coverage of the war?
5827,there's times i need to pay bills.
5828,you don't see that much.
5829,afghan hound and chow.
5830,no decisions have been made at this time.
5831,they're up there also.
5832,i've known people that have used a package.
5833,who you never expect to win.
5834,then it takes three weeks in all.
5835,he attached himself to a couple of those.
5836,what kind of business is it?
5837,you can see the code at this point as well.
5838,i thought it was pretty good.
5839,i am an asian woman with a white boyfriend.
5840,i don't know if dallas is in the top three.
5841,i do plant a lot of beans.
5842,it's so funny.
5843,nobody uses anything that's smaller.
5844,they take their family.
5845,you can get that too.
5846,i put in a dollar.
5847,we do have one in.
5848,you're just a youngster then.
5849,now we start in may.
5850,i'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off.
5851,good storage capacity in it.
5852,i'm in one community band here.
5853,that's destroying the ozone.
5854,it's too expensive.
5855,that's what they said.
5856,i really haven't seen any movies lately.
5857,i may have to see the video.
5858,there isn't any.
5859,i work with the state.
5860,but the thing was that i could do the job myself.
5861,that's all i have is boys.
5862,seems like the whole world.
5863,how shall i say it?
5864,if you didn't mind me asking.
5865,i didn't have any answer for that one.
5866,the taxes on gasoline don't.
5867,maybe that has a lot to do with it.
5868,all you can do is put it in words.
5869,even doing that three or four times a week.
5870,obviously not of the original time schedule.
5871,they don't see each other very often.
5872,my point of view.
5873,i think that's a shame they need to.
5874,it's a real good book.
5875,i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon.
5876,i don't like having credit cards for every store.
5877,he has been so pleased.
5878,it's going to happen all the time.
5879,that's fairly easy for me to work on.
5880,we know what we can do.
5881,people have to be involved.
5882,gardening in texas is really interesting.
5883,they do have a variety of topics.
5884,from the dallas area.

5886,i've been here three years.
5887,well there's not any.
5888,there's a ring and you buy a present.
5889,you wear a jacket.

5891,that's the way they wanted to do it.
5892,an american grocery store now.
5893,i just got married.
5894,i use my personal computer constantly.
5895,who claimed that?
5896,he'd be running with a gun.
5897,i guess it has been a couple of years ago.
5898,i don't really know for sure.
5899,that's how life goes.
5900,it was something easily forgotten.
5901,rent all the movies.

5924,a little bit with refugees.
5925,we moved in about four years ago.
5926,on monday evening.
5927,that was outside.
5928,i keep thinking that there's got to be some way.
5929,government contracts.
5930,and so i just recently discovered jazzercise.

5949,my children are all grown up.
5950,paid normal taxes.

5956,after that's cooked.
5957,you're welcome anytime without notice.
5958,if nobody complains you're all right.

5963,they just maybe work harder.
5964,i really don't want to stay in news.
5965,they talk about wind chill here all the time.
5966,you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody.

5968,than he thought it would be.
5969,the course that they should go.
5970,you still need your mother.
5971,little bit of soy sauce.
5972,it would be nice to see it take a good turn here.
5973,we've only lived here a couple of years.
5974,because of a service that they could provide.
5975,it's not that far.
5976,if there are some people who don't agree.
5977,if you had children.
5978,usually don't exceed that.

6001,there are a number of good movies like that.
6002,you're not finishing a quilt in a long time.
6003,maybe people are becoming more aware.
6004,basically it's a market survey.
6005,i'm familiar with that one.
6006,i have this really good recipe for this.
6007,because you put such a commitment on education.
6008,some old movie.

6039,i'm up there at my kids' school.

6041,do we think that the government should fund it?

6084,we got pretty lucky on that.
6085,i wouldn't take it apart.
6086,i was thinking about throwing some.
6087,two seasons and that would be spring and fall.
6088,i have to be real careful.
6089,you need a special nursing home for that.
6090,i was impressed by them.

6093,in terms of demanding.
6094,the kids having to give up his.

6127,i didn't even really think about it that much.
6128,for the month.

6647,just jumped right into the job.
6648,he's going to.
6649,i have a standard.
6650,well i fell in love with this.
6651,do not even bother.
6652,taking what you're saying at face value.
6653,mine looks real good.
6654,the lower cholesterol foods and stuff.
6655,the headlines on the news.
6656,her life was a lot simpler.
6657,you just have to decide.
6658,just let me see what i got.
6659,isn't that interesting?
6660,a person's heart can be changed.
6661,she's more famous for that.
6662,what's going on in the city council?
6663,that was back in my daddy's day.
6664,it's channel thirteen.
6665,not one dime is deducted from his check.
6666,it's pretty soon.
6667,she'd just get on the first step and lay down.
6668,they're real difficult to catch.
6669,i have a really easy recipe for that.
6670,i need to get better at it though.
6671,i grew up in alabama.
6672,maybe south.
6673,so i can wander around.
6674,what are you doing with that?
6675,if i had all the money i wanted.
6676,sleeping bags.
6677,instead of being completely penned up.
6678,that's not so bad.
6679,in a way it's not.
6680,it shouldn't be that way i don't think.
6681,voiceover dialogue spoken text script or lyrics.
6682,i have not gone back lately.
6683,what do you think of the spoilers?
6684,they pay so much of it.
6685,many of the casualties are women and children.
6686,between the rows and all.
6687,speaking of noise.
6688,i have no choice but to complete the mission.
6689,what are some of the benefits of visualization?
6690,how do you measure it?
6691,this is the vision that we have.
6692,but there was also a sad little voice in my head.
6693,so it's not all that unusual.
6694,is that what comes in those little blocks?
6695,the measure passed the house by a voice vote.
6696,a very true axiom.
6697,it was a tough decision.
6698,you usually have to grow up with it to enjoy it.
6699,it's pretty much filled up right now.
6700,we don't take the newspaper to begin with.
6701,how do you make a genre film your own?
6702,she asked them there if there was some.
6703,it might let more people get off.
6704,tax year of eighty one.
6705,her brow furrowed in confusion.
6706,bring the pot to a boil.
6707,as usual he did an amazing job.
6708,help guide some craft programs.
6709,i think it's a great idea.
6710,what's the problem with business as usual?
6711,what have your shows been like to this point?
6712,through natural understanding.
6713,i tend to listen to the classical music.
6714,so much about that movie.
6715,when i was growing up.
6716,eyes are the same color and everything.
6717,i wanted something else to do.
6718,so this is just a starting point.
6719,but at this point the facts speak for themselves.
6720,i'm not sure what happened.
6721,what do i have to do she asked her voice very.
6722,his story is not unusual.
6723,that's a wonderful way to get off jury duty.
6724,it's just too high.
6725,who was raised by christian parents?
6726,it's a very short drive to areas near here.
6727,especially when it feels like there is no point.
6728,above all what i want to do is enjoy it.
6729,a certain percentage.
6730,germany is a case in point.
6731,both sides are bracing themselves for a decision.

6733,at some point enough is enough.
6734,i am kind of a hobbyist.
6735,manage your app in the azure portal.
6736,i think those guys should be done away with.
6737,but when i do it usually brings me joy.
6738,decisions will be based on science and evidence.
6739,i made a decision in a moment of madness.
6740,we had the same kind of problem.
6741,have a less conscientious effort.
6742,they were told that.
6743,a lot of restaurants don't take.
6744,reports on the occasion of the sixth anniversary.
6745,i don't do much with it.
6746,that's why they were opposed to it.
6747,passing that on to each other.
6748,go here to register and let your voice be heard.
6749,we are quite simply at a tipping point.
6750,let us come to a conclusion.
6751,did the drug testing thing after that.
6752,there's a whole bunch of people.
6753,i could get a real good paying job.
6754,no casualties were reported.
6755,but he says the exact number is hard to pinpoint.
6756,they didn't have enough teachers.
6757,i think it would be fair.
6758,we apologize for the confusion this caused.
6759,he slapped me and pointed the gun at my head.
6760,the meaning of those words.
6761,hope you all enjoy!

6764,investment is also affected by the tax regime.
6765,is there a price point or release date in mind?

6776,that decision is expected early next week.
6777,they're dangerous.
6778,that that will come about.
6779,you can avoid this problem in two ways.
6780,stay safe and enjoy your time out there.
6781,when they cut in and say.
6782,but it's so darn expensive to go over.
6783,and yet how many of us have ever heard his voice?
6784,are you involved in any other?
6785,how old are you all?
6786,it's still there.
6787,that was a turning point in the war.

6789,the nursing home.
6790,she hasn't talked to anybody.
6791,he leaped out of the way to avoid being struck.
6792,if there's no economic benefit.
6793,there's always going to be a dispute.
6794,kind of a picnic in the woods type thing.
6795,they don't make pragmatic decisions.
6796,i think we have one of the nicest yards.
6797,the top headlines are always a murder.
6798,it's very successful for some.

6806,less than half the trials.
6807,let's get to the inevitable conclusion.
6808,sell you magazines.
6809,however i could sort of understand the decision.
6810,so at one point i had a snake.
6811,at the same point.
6812,pedestrians were reminded to avoid the area.
6813,local high school.
6814,to be my two favorite shows.

6820,well what do you do on your yard?
6821,it is atlanta.

6841,that's what i had the opportunity of.
6842,i know dave fox.
6843,i think he can be.

6857,i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet.
6858,i remember it.

6862,my mother was real heavy into crafts.
6863,like in emergencies.

6872,it becomes more evident.
6873,they are doing such a terrific job back there.

6876,i would like to see them go through either.

6879,there's a good point.
6880,they're burning that diesel fuel.
6881,it just kind of feeds itself.
6882,they leave it up to you and your judgment.
6883,i didn't realize.
6884,all of her dreams will be dispelled.
6885,it seems like the stuff that they put out now.

6887,even the generation before me.
6888,i'm a former athlete in a sense.
6889,i kind of like to do a little bit of sewing.

6898,about three or four years old.
6899,that's before your time.
6900,doesn't seem like we have got much.
6901,they just try and make it a personal thing.
6902,you think that would be a deterrent.
6903,that's exactly what i have.
6904,it was quite popular.
6905,their success rate is very high.
6906,is this pat i'm talking to now?

6920,i still didn't want her to go to a day care.
6921,why should i even vote?
6922,i know two women.

6942,it's kind of more of a country setting.
6943,it was kind of getting to me.

6963,that was a scream.
6964,special interest groups can blow up.

7036,all this kind of stuff.
7037,now it doesn't bother me at all.
7038,just like a pig i mean.

7055,i lived in detroit.
7056,i'm not real sure how that goes.

7066,not going to run again after this.
7067,time and mistakes and they're both inevitable.

7069,dishes that are fixed in a chinese restaurant.
7070,what have you done?
7071,that's why i said.
7072,i couldn't believe how much.
7073,in other words there is a choice.
7074,i don't carry cash around.
7075,you got your calipers there.
7076,budgeting and some extra things.
7077,he called in to get somebody on the line.

7080,they seem to loose it.
7081,in town she does okay.
7082,then add soil to the bottom of your bonsai pot.
7083,this brings me to my next point though.
7084,i sometimes think that.
7085,at work that does that.
7086,in any event my decision was made days ago.
7087,i don't know what you do with them at that point.
7088,if i want to do that.
7089,cohen has denied any collusion with russia.
7090,we just made a decision and moved on.
7091,one of the questions they asked.
7092,hope you enjoyed it.
7093,the big one i thought was very commercialized.
7094,it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste.
7095,the death penalty.
7096,that idea fits me exactly.
7097,we put this stuff on.
7098,it wasn't creative.
7099,have something to do with it.
7100,go over there and rebuild all those.
7101,there's not that much of a check.
7102,your point of view and i think that's neat.
7103,when they were coming up.
7104,renamed their jobs.
7105,age or even physical.
7106,do you have a rotary tiller?
7107,this was when the peace corps first our started.

7114,regular pitching and my eleven year old.
7115,effective punishments.
7116,i would not have.
7117,they beat him up and took his gun and shot him.
7118,poor or in between.
7119,it's kind of early.
7120,employees have all the rights that workers have.
7121,sort of dangerous to be out there.

7124,luckily someone came by and gave me a ride.
7125,they're so young.
7126,let the voice of the people be heard.
7127,those people simply did not have access to safety.
7128,i wish if they were going to do it.
7129,charges against the boy have been dropped.
7130,maybe now things are calming down again.
7131,that's a hard issue.
7132,i mean a lot of people do it really the reverse.
7133,the policeman's associations.
7134,that they have started.
7135,my mother used to put that curse on my sister.

7155,i think it's a foregone conclusion.
7156,there's too many toxins and bacterial growth.
7157,eventually the decision was made.
7158,this can be seen as a measure of expertise.
7159,just when i thought i really enjoyed my hobby.
7160,then you remove it.
7161,cowboys are going to have a problem arent they.

7349,you consider how much.
7350,regardless whether it's north dallas or what not.

7496,what you're describing is actually a conflict.
7497,that i think should change.
7498,several things that clog the courts.
7499,i wouldn't want them to be on drugs.
7500,and it's a real turn off to see.

7506,if i'm lucky.

7523,my wife kind of laughs.
7524,all of the stations seem to be pretty good.
7525,it's the taxes here.
7526,orthodontic care.
7527,they didn't go to vote against.
7528,it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse.
7529,well that's a neat idea.
7530,maybe if they ever get to the point.
7531,handle and perform better.
7532,that's because i'm allergic to the grass.
7533,should he be for this and on and on and on.
7534,as far as this country is concerned.
7535,he would get all upset.
7536,at least we hope it will.

7547,twelve or fifteen thousand miles.
7548,i guess i'm like a lot of other people.
7549,i think the majority are in that.
7550,that's always good.
7551,it's going to be hard to.
7552,i don't understand.
7553,a lot of days i'll get two and three calls.
7554,on our closest neighbors like mexico and canada.
7555,i would love to.
7556,you do have government money to fund.
7557,that was pretty heart rending for her.
7558,they don't have a disk drive.
7559,boy i'd sure like to.
7560,it does a lot for you i think.
7561,when the earthquake hit.
7562,that can't be good for los angeles either.
7563,i don't know what it's like.
7564,i like to visit with my company.
7565,do you belong to that?
7566,then don't pay it.
7567,i'm sure it creates a large amount.
7568,really major job.
7569,if it's going to make any effect.
7570,i just put that in.
7571,i seem to feel the same way.
7572,i've got about twelve tickets in the mail.

7579,it seems to be validated by the press.
7580,i do not know what.
7581,when you make that point.
7582,this was in louisiana.
7583,she was in there first.
7584,i think that would be a wonderful way to do it.
7585,why don't you go ahead and start?
7586,last week we got a lot.
7587,everybody hopes that.
7588,where you live now?
7589,i don't really like the pirates.
7590,well have we reached our limit?
7591,i don't know why it's so hard to find.
7592,preparing is a real problem.
7593,what are the ages of your kids then?
7594,i don't really particularly like but.
7595,i don't remember which other one it was.

7687,lo and behold.
7688,they had to abide by the rules.
7689,tomatoes grow like crazy at our house.
7690,i tend to agree with you.
7691,if you don't pay it off within that month.
7692,i'm not the one who writes the orders.
7693,not going from side to side.
7694,what are you thinking about buying?
7695,there needs to be a line drawn somewhere.
7696,some people seem very well suited.

7707,there is kind of a set pattern to it.
7708,my kids were born.
7709,did you have training in singing?
7710,just pocket change to a lot of people.
7711,we're living longer and people are less trusting.

7723,seventy nine degrees.
7724,with other things going on.
7725,some more jewelry.
7726,is it legend?
7727,did you see any of those?
7728,i didn't feel like she was mature enough socially.
7729,it's not as severe.
7730,tell them some of the things we're doing.
7731,you don't want to do that.
7732,even what you recycle.
7733,they were very flexible.
7734,i never did get into them.
7735,i've always had a big interest.
7736,it gets a little aggravating.
7737,they've got a nice one.
7738,i wonder what the next generation will be like.
7739,there was no structure.
7740,we tried to do it every other month.

7764,sounds like a place where i grew up.
7765,it's not that big a thing this year.

7777,when he sees it to his advantage.
7778,it's a precious movie.
7779,that makes a decent salary.
7780,i don't have any good ideas.
7781,then it gets to where he can't.
7782,and i think it's showing up in their automobiles.
7783,if i miss something big deal.
7784,i thought it was great.
7785,i just keep them.
7786,through to the system.
7787,it would be nice but i kind of like the freedom.
7788,it looked to me like it was a real submarine.
7789,a longer period of time.
7790,when i was still smoking.
7791,we're retired now.

7796,they pick that up on monday.
7797,have you noticed that?
7798,miles per hour to kilometers per hour.
7799,a lot of people they flunk out.
7800,there's not a lot of pressure to.
7801,it's a lot of fun.
7802,it's going to be on a cruise.
7803,i do not have one of my own at home.
7804,people will have batteries.

7820,domino's a real good dog.

7823,which i thought was a lot.
7824,especially for repeat offenders.
7825,the situations are out there.
7826,you didn't have home computers.
7827,it's like god changes your heart to not do that.
7828,yes and i think we do get pretty good coverage.

7830,all right i'm ready to go.
7831,post high school.

7844,call my own hours.
7845,are there kids that are there too?

7855,in terms of drugs.
7856,my father owns a restaurant.
7857,that's one thing about cats though.

7859,or a monthly budget.
7860,the next like my cousin's children.
7861,then it became winter.
7862,two girls and two boys.

7867,the monitoring is not that bad.
7868,other three who went.
7869,take a lot of chances.
7870,at least traditionally.
7871,that is exactly where we are.
7872,i think they're going to.
7873,i like to think that i'm a very good cook.

7887,train accidents and everything else.
7888,that is mediation training.
7889,that's not her bag.
7890,so i can't complain too much.
7891,since there is much that needs to be done here.
7892,they said something to improve voting.
7893,it's your choice where you want to go.
7894,if it goes down.

7900,before i moved out here.
7901,light reading.
7902,criticize you or put something in there wrong.
7903,it was a little bit hard to.
7904,i like groups like that.
7905,the way they behave.
7906,he dug a hole under the fence.
7907,you've passed me up.
7908,to continue in that vein.
7909,i'm sure i didn't.
7910,they keep calling back.
7911,does it cost the same for just two nights?
7912,a particular kind of shoe.
7913,i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing.
7914,i'd tell him.
7915,a matter of choice.
7916,that lived in new york or out of state.
7917,those are really nice.
7918,i've never had a call.
7919,the last time we had some.
7920,had somehow gotten in.
7921,now that i'm older.
7922,that's good to hear.
7923,quite a bit more taxes.
7924,do you paint or anything like that?
7925,you can take those.
7926,i heard it one time.
7927,steel products abroad as much as we bring in.

7930,in the rice steamer.
7931,what i have to ship.
7932,you're allowed to show their character.
7933,they've always been with us.
7934,well mine's getting there.
7935,it's a four door which is nice.
7936,we had two baseball bleachers full of people.

7946,have an electric car.
7947,i hope everything works out up there.
7948,we don't usually mix.
7949,like a taste of something different.
7950,sometimes it's rewarding.
7951,that's what i said.
7952,that can stay in power.
7953,i was very offended.
7954,they think that's a family activity.
7955,their downstairs area.
7956,trafficking has got them.
7957,they come out fairly easily.
7958,i've just never been called up.
7959,i was from illinois.

7962,you have a bonus.
7963,you can as a teacher.
7964,i bought shoes.
7965,it's going to be reduced.
7966,this is an invasion of privacy issue.
7967,more like the sixties and that kind of stuff.
7968,the quality of the news you get.
7969,how are we going to fix that?
7970,it's very degrading.
7971,all those nursing majors.
7972,he'll change out a light switch.
7973,there is lots to see.
7974,before they started.
7975,to really challenge them.
7976,it's not the same with johnny carson.
7977,i guess i'll get over it.
7978,to deal with in some quality way.
7979,i don't want any interruptions.
7980,i've heard they're terrible.
7981,do you want to start?
7982,it works just fine.
7983,i think they're a good team.
7984,the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground.
7985,the regular hospital.
7986,it's been quite a few years.
7987,i am an asian woman with a white boyfriend.
7988,i guess it's too early.
7989,i think they are.
7990,it went quite a long way.
7991,the girl is four.
7992,exactly the same thing.
7993,now we come to the hard decision.
7994,there is a long way between now and that point.
7995,maybe one or two country and western.
7996,it's nice talking to you.
7997,although they don't admit to it.
7998,information systems.
7999,it's like bragging on your grandchildren.
8000,where do you go camping at around here?
8001,it still looked real nice.
8002,those were the general issues.
8003,now it's looking better to me.
8004,they just kind of forget us on that end.
8005,actually purchase the gun.
8006,since i've got cats.
8007,the kids of these people.
8008,it did not really mean anything to me.
8009,and then you just cook them over a grill.
8010,i can honestly say we do.
8011,march the fifteenth before it was prepared.
8012,when i first started working.
8013,i'd like to get the weight off.
8014,i used to use it quite a bit.
8015,mine's about twenty seven hundred square foot.
8016,that makes you real good.
8017,you could hardly wait.
8018,maybe when you are there.
8019,you said something else.
8020,i don't know what they are right now.
8021,that is the key to the longevity.
8022,well that's the way mine is.
8023,it was about four or five years ago.
8024,we bought a second hand.
8025,they just accept it.
8026,time flies so fast.
8027,the thing i really worry about.
8028,that might be too crude to be called woodworking.
8029,buy one get one free.
8030,it's going to take me a lot longer.
8031,so what do you do up there?
8032,a couple of children and we have two.
8033,i think i'd agree.
8034,now that's inside again.
8035,when you have children.
8036,i did the dance step.
8037,how many do you have?
8038,the hard back copy of it.
8039,they basically would have.
8040,i saw plenty of jokes.
8041,that's neat isn't it?
8042,it's not a big deal really.
8043,it seems like dallas was so open.
8044,it was my mother's uncle.
8045,it says they won't eat the babies.
8046,and they don't have a waiting period.
8047,it's like a major production.
8048,the presence over in the persian gulf.
8049,you have to get everything replaced.
8050,i'd have to basically say my birth.
8051,we were going to be metric.
8052,i made some of them with that hair.
8053,where they go for an hour or so.
8054,covered it with grass.
8055,it had all the vegetables in it.
8056,i ran my kids to death i said.
8057,the immune system can at first slow down.
8058,i watched that game.
8059,rehabilitate you.
8060,it was interesting.
8061,i want to make a lot of money.
8062,you're kidding.
8063,i'll probably have to sell the prize i get.
8064,probably seventies.
8065,it's not good for a second watching particularly.
8066,there's a lot of sections to it.
8067,my cars don't go to the shop.
8068,they really hadn't either.
8069,like nineteen times.
8070,i better make some calls.
8071,maybe you're still allergic to the dog.
8072,but i never count right.
8073,mostly they are token cuts.
8074,now in criminal i guess you always have a jury.
8075,so we're attempting it.
8076,especially not in some of these big cities.
8077,i've had one idea.
8078,get a home.
8079,or else we're going to be out of business.
8080,i am pretty aware of what goes on.
8081,of course at that point we couldn't afford it.
8082,what is it called?
8083,it's just a terrible choice.
8084,i can't remember which.
8085,i don't know if you've heard of her.
8086,how are you doing today?
8087,this bad for so long.
8088,it's either me or the dog.
8089,that's pretty much what it is.
8090,definitely when it's cool.
8091,a friend of mine saw it and she said it was okay.
8092,something every day.
8093,i mean to use any of the facilities.
8094,your family doesn't live close.
8095,they're all kind of local and close.
8096,we have been trying for kids.
8097,to work in some programs.
8098,we felt guilty.
8099,is peace corps still active down in there?
8100,my resting pulse.
8101,i think that's most of it personally.
8102,the guy gets captured by that woman.
8103,i'm sure it does.
8104,i guess that's kind of like the way we do.
8105,they're really good cars.
8106,people find ways around.
8107,there is some danger to that.
8108,have you read any good novels lately?
8109,that's just an extreme example.
8110,you take care.
8111,how i would feel if one of my parents came with.
8112,murdered and so i really wouldn't know.
8113,to return to her apartment again.
8114,but you got to like queen also.
8115,see it's about six years old now.
8116,so i called them and asked if i could participate.
8117,member of the american meteorological society.
8118,a lot of their things.
8119,for all the older people.
8120,at least the parents did.
8121,then you could get it at the reunion.
8122,those are the only states i have not visited.
8123,unique show and very well done.
8124,i can't disagree with that.
8125,have established the defendant's innocence.
8126,i haven't quite figured that out.
8127,it was paid for.
8128,because the porch is pretty big.
8129,i don't know exactly what's hot down in texas.
8130,with whoever is taking care of the child.
8131,is it all voluntary?
8132,in the winter we do more concert stuff.
8133,they had snacks and story time and everything.
8134,a big expenditure to start.
8135,some of those countries were so safe.
8136,some really good years.
8137,that's not very likely.
8138,so i don't mind doing it so much anymore.
8139,i also got a piece of chrome.
8140,a little more assertive.
8141,i wore some fairly nice jeans.
8142,i guess i was about ten when it ended.
8143,on going project.
8144,we have a dog too so that adds to it.
8145,beginning of my junior year.
8146,that's our channel here.
8147,she is more wrinkled.
8148,that's what i see burning a lot.
8149,according to the following utterance.
8150,we're kind of at the end of that trail.
8151,here we are talking on that subject.
8152,is it cayenne pepper?
8153,you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle.
8154,they have really simplified things.
8155,you can pick anything you want.
8156,how do you feel about it?
8157,i never see that.
8158,was it very expensive?
8159,that's what i was.
8160,throw the paper away.
8161,no frivolous gifts.
8162,my daughter in law is panamanian.
8163,are they going to later?
8164,i took a drive up through there.
8165,now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure.
8166,january or february.
8167,we didn't understand the culture.
8168,you can program the one at cosmopolitan lady.
8169,if not the biggest yard.
8170,the last presidential election.
8171,to finance or accounting.
8172,every thursday night.
8173,they get lighter sentences.
8174,an awful lot of people are in trouble.
8175,there is just so much going on.
8176,i really like it.
8177,i guess we're talking about exercise.
8178,twice for the same crime.
8179,that's very spicy.
8180,to have enough time to spend with matthew.
8181,they had us fill out a long questionnaire.
8182,could be just about equal.
8183,but they're not making new ones.
8184,it had such a good story.
8185,except the three networks.
8186,the dryer had to have a new heating element.
8187,isaiah came back this week.
8188,don't you hate that?
8189,my husband is real into sports too.
8190,set back in the woods.
8191,an english setter.
8192,the insides of the door panels.
8193,they just raised them to twelve this year.
8194,well that's understandable.
8195,what do you think is your primary cause of it?
8196,the nature stuff.
8197,it's always had its own unique look.
8198,i lived in places.
8199,then do it that way.
8200,if i lived in new york city or washington.
8201,i'm not doing it as much as i need to.
8202,rugby every now and then.
8203,are you a hacker?
8204,he just piddle on this and that.
8205,like in a dead end job.
8206,as they occur all over the world.
8207,she can't run in the morning.

8241,it's like any other company.
8242,do you get money for it?
8243,i didn't need it.
8244,so they just wear them right into the pool.

8271,i think you're right there.
8272,this will be new for me.
8273,probably you're right.
8274,you need to rent the first one first.

8297,stick it in the hole.
8298,do you still keep up with them?
8299,i don't use the free weights.
8300,if you are convinced that it is the right choice.

8316,just about anybody you could name.
8317,i had heard a couple of people.
8318,i can get this yard in shape.
8319,i decided that there was no point in replying.
8320,we just had a ball.
8321,that makes it very frustrating.
8322,what's your name?
8323,it seems sad to me.
8324,a man who owns a building company.
8325,the court is yet to make its decision public.
8326,it's amazing how much we spend on some things.
8327,that really ticks me off.
8328,we could spend that money.
8329,i think we agree a lot on that.
8330,learn how to measure and score it here.
8331,if we are not the voice of outrage who will be?
8332,i don't have too much on credit cards.
8333,i never knew that.

8347,we always had horses.
8348,i hope you guys enjoy it.

8358,six thousand is just getting broken in for them.

8360,if there is a decision to make they speak first.
8361,i don't think we need a whole church.
8362,before he was really active.
8363,i'm kind of mixed on it.
8364,they also have sales taxes.
8365,it's really hard to.
8366,i guess we do get it from people too.
8367,i can't wait to get out of high school.

8369,i listen to the radio.
8370,more or less at home.

8374,i think they're getting ready to.
8375,well he does not usually drink he says.
8376,they would have been able to find him.
8377,it's the thirty five or forty thousand dollar one.
8378,tree bark all over her lawn.
8379,they didn't have this problem back then.
8380,just when i was in high school.
8381,well that's good.
8382,i voted with my feet.
8383,they can get away with one guy like that.
8384,regime change in iran.
8385,two thousand and ten was far better.
8386,it's hard to beat any of the benefits.
8387,a meal without any vegetables at all.
8388,the other place is called the vienna inn.
8389,i almost think there's some politics around here.
8390,things of that nature which made us feel good.
8391,then his voice started to get raspy.
8392,shut my other radio off here.
8393,i thought he was kind of cocky or something.
8394,it came out in the theater.
8395,i went back to school.
8396,it's doing a lot of damage.
8397,absent a dust cloud there will be no explosion.
8398,did you enjoy this recipe?
8399,especially if you're in a lot of traffic.
8400,uses more muscles than any other exercise.
8401,i'm hoping they'll have some kind of medicine.
8402,sort of mixed feelings about it.
8403,after they've gone and done horrible things.
8404,a gun is a gun to them.
8405,a fairly large liberal arts college as well.

8409,now where do they live?
8410,even at a group rate.

8412,all i knew was you go to high school.
8413,been here all my life.
8414,you mean she taught in a prison?
8415,are you recycling?
8416,that and then i wasn't able to.
8417,i don't know that anybody would feel good.
8418,say the rice dish.
8419,which is the strangest thing i had ever heard.
8420,they fixed us up with an office.
8421,exactly what i did.
8422,mad at themselves when they don't do well.
8423,you knock people down.
8424,they want him because he's popular.
8425,i'm of italian descent.
8426,if you're serving another dish with it.
8427,they've not had to do that all year.
8428,she wrestled with the decision.
8429,the absolute top of the line.
8430,boxes that they use.
8431,we'll try to be real quick here.
8432,he has a vision for the program.
8433,you can take out the middle seat.
8434,we have hard decisions to make she said.
8435,i have heard about that.
8436,i do believe it should be befitting the crime.
8437,these were soviet made.
8438,their training isn't what we need in this country.
8439,about a quarter acre of that.
8440,i looked over at the card and made a decision.
8441,to buy my gas with.
8442,it's just so smooth.
8443,this plea bargaining baloney.
8444,i'm a dog person.
8445,our division does not have a dress code policy.
8446,this can't be done by moral suasion.
8447,just to let you know.
8448,everybody is napping.
8449,prisons all my life.
8450,just last week.
8451,the cleanliness and that type of thing.
8452,very twisty stuff.
8453,or how you think this court case should have gone.
8454,i wanted someone to make my decision for me.
8455,interstate driving.
8456,we want to hear your voice.
8457,portland's pretty good.
8458,they have all really got really good jobs.

8460,hundred and two sometimes.
8461,the decision rests as always with the referees.
8462,he's run into so many problems.
8463,it was a night out.
8464,i know where my son works.
8465,our gardening we lost.
8466,seeing new england.
8467,starting to learn the colors.
8468,it seems sensible and failsafe.
8469,show some respect.
8470,then you can't spend it.
8471,and there was much rejoicing.
8472,get up during every commercial.
8473,are you enjoying it?
8474,turns out it was a prescription.
8475,did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to?
8476,how do you usually eat it?
8477,i couldn't even go there.
8478,he's doing some other movie.
8479,then it goes to the next point and so on.
8480,last time i saw the paper earlier this week.
8481,you never get a chance to read.
8482,in the punishment phase.
8483,i had two cadillacs.
8484,we got a chance to make some noise this year.
8485,we went to six flags saturday.
8486,i think that's the main problem.
8487,i'd like to see silence of the lambs.
8488,i think that's bad.
8489,if a child is a visual learner.
8490,anything on that.
8491,gives drug testing.
8492,we know the consequences of that decision.
8493,employees will not get any severance pay.

8501,it drives me crazy.
8502,i just do it all.
8503,you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy.
8504,was it a big change in your life?
8505,it's on down the line.
8506,twenty five in interest charges.
8507,it would be ridiculous.
8508,nobody could figure it out.
8509,or a row of seats actually.
8510,you understand what i am saying.
8511,to take care of a problem before it grows big.
8512,there was no word on casualties.
8513,the reality is it's usually not the case.
8514,i'm not sure.
8515,it's actually turning out to be more.
8516,be our first chance in a while.
8517,it's too bad it happened.
8518,i have the right to voice my opinion.
8519,still have to spray some.
8520,my mother was complaining last year about that.
8521,when i come back to my seat.
8522,that texas spring or whatever you want to call it.
8523,nothing wrong with those.
8524,i love this country too much.
8525,who did they play?
8526,they were thrown forward.
8527,that can show up as a positive test.
8528,become an issue you could say.
8529,we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all.
8530,that's an interesting notion.
8531,if we didn't have it.
8532,that was the time to instill it.
8533,i am a golfer.
8534,they'll have these little parties.
8535,if they started executing them on a regular basis.
8536,they're testing that.
8537,whatever you decide.
8538,they each have their own television.
8539,now do things like plant bushes and trees.
8540,a tent by the lake type situation.
8541,the political aspect.
8542,we've just about used up our time here.
8543,that's what always amazes me.
8544,people get very upset.
8545,dallas has a guy.
8546,just all different colors.
8547,use those facilities quite often.
8548,i mean he's doing all right.
8549,not just in quantity.
8550,i work at a bakery.
8551,being a mini van.
8552,in terms of motivation and incentive.
8553,it's like you listen to bush.
8554,we're both school teachers.
8555,i don't know why i never registered it.
8556,when you're first married or starting out.
8557,it just depends on what kind they are.
8558,at the craft shop.
8559,how long did that movie run?
8560,or maybe twenty dollars.
8561,my husband does the same thing.
8562,i haven't had to replace the thing yet.
8563,not all the time.
8564,that's awful.
8565,you're not old.
8566,i've never been up there.
8567,some good books that i've read.
8568,there's some different things.
8569,those are running.
8570,pretty much the end of may.
8571,i don't get that.
8572,no there's no way.
8573,well maybe that is another factor.
8574,so you go back and visit with her anyway.
8575,it's not clear to me that it is really a problem.
8576,i've used a substantial amount of shareware.
8577,his daddy owned a boat shop.
8578,if you let one little law get through.
8579,including rural districts.
8580,the child's love and security.

8583,made payments on our things.
8584,always home by the time you got home.
8585,will you help me with my homework?
8586,if he can keep that correlation together.
8587,you would dust every day.
8588,and of course sometimes they rent movies.
8589,it is frightening.
8590,i enjoyed our discussion.
8591,haven't had any parakeets for quite a while.
8592,that hadn't crossed my mind.
8593,doing the sentencing.
8594,at least into kindergarten.
8595,it comes down to a one word against the other.
8596,when they do go out.
8597,the marching band.
8598,they didn't have any time doing it the first time.
8599,now we get channel fifty five.
8600,changing the plugs and stuff.
8601,they have a new one now.
8602,how long you been in san antonio?
8603,i forget which way we do it.

8605,without me working.
8606,i like just looking at the billboards.
8607,their mother was sick at times.
8608,that's probably a major one.
8609,you don't need to drag it down the hall.
8610,we found a real good interest rate.
8611,it's kind of hard.
8612,it's really made such a difference for her.
8613,i just pretend they're not there.
8614,i don't get any of that bull.
8615,if this would be helpful.
8616,an exotic pet shop out in california.
8617,is it like a foreign exchange type student?
8618,elected not to do so.
8619,they were great men.
8620,replace some of the belts.
8621,the great audience.
8622,plastic and paper.
8623,it took me back to the sixties.
8624,little things like that.
8625,what i have to do.
8626,you either pay the thing off or they come get it.
8627,without any warning whatsoever.
8628,substantial amounts of money.
8629,that's the way they suck you in.
8630,the kids in that class.
8631,i'm a practicing vegetarian.
8632,with the jury actually making the verdict.
8633,my husband is a movie fanatic.
8634,there's still a big question in my mind.
8635,i really miss them.
8636,thirty to fifty pages a day.

8645,we're going to try and have her stay home.
8646,the blue mesa grill.
8647,it's not that he can't do it.
8648,since they don't have the yearly fee.
8649,i don't know how valid it is.
8650,it's more efficient to do things yourself.
8651,what are dialing services?
8652,is that portland?
8653,i really like it a lot.
8654,i think we use it for christmas.
8655,that's what you do with a catfish.

8686,so the doctor elected to have her.

8716,these kids work really hard.
8717,they had a centennial here awhile back.

8720,the teachers in the middle.
8721,commercial television these days.
